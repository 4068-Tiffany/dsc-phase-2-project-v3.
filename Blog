### What I Learned From My First Data Science Project: More Than Just Numbers ###
When I started learning data science, I thought it was all about coding. If you can write some Python, you’re a data scientist, right?
Turns out, I couldn’t have been more wrong.

This project opened my eyes to what data science really is.

**Step 1: Curiosity Comes First**
Everything started with a question:

**Do popular movies always mean good movies?**

It sounded simple, but this question guided my entire journey.
I learned that the heart of data science is curiosity.
If you can’t ask the right question, no amount of coding will save you.

**Step 2: Cleaning** 
Reality check:
70% of my time was spent cleaning the data.
First I imported the datasets:

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

conn = sqlite3.connect('im.db')

tables = conn.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';").fetchall()
print([t[0] for t in tables])
```

Then i started cleaning;

There were missing values everywhere.
Some tables didn’t even agree on column names.
One dataset was in SQL, the other was in Excel!

I learned that clean data is the foundation of everything.
Garbage data? Garbage results just as my instructor once said

Step 3: SQL and Pandas
Once my data was finally clean, I needed to bring everything together.
This is where SQL and Pandas came in.

```python
query = """
SELECT b.primary_title,b.start_year,r.averagerating,t.popularity,t.vote_average, p.person_id, p.category
FROM movie_basics AS b
JOIN movie_ratings AS r
    ON b.movie_id = r.movie_id
JOIN tmdb_movies AS t
    ON b.primary_title = t.original_title AND b.start_year = t.year
LEFT JOIN principals AS p
    ON b.movie_id = p.movie_id;
"""
```

merged_basic = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
print("Rows in basic merge:", merged_basic.shape)
merged_basic.head()


SQL helped me join multiple tables.

Pandas made it easy to manipulate the data in Python.

It felt like I was finally in control of my data.

Step 4: Visualization – When Data Speaks
Here’s where the fun began.
I plotted scatterplots, line charts, and bar graphs to explore patterns.
With Tableau, I built dashboards that made my data come alive.

For the first time, I saw the story hidden inside the numbers:
     -Popularity is rising in recent years
     -Ratings have stayed fairly stable
     -Some genres (like Drama) shine in ratings even if they are not the most hyped

Step 5: Insights and Storytelling
My biggest insight?
Popularity does not always mean quality.

But here’s the bigger lesson:
No one will care about your data unless you can tell a good story with it.

I learned how important communication is in data science.

What I’ll Take With Me
This project taught me that data science is not about fancy algorithms.
It’s about:
    -Asking good questions
    -Cleaning and organizing messy data
    -Looking for patterns
    -Communicating insights clearly

I’m excited to keep practicing and to see where this journey takes me next.

**Tools I used**: Python, Pandas, SQL, Tableau, Seaborn, Matplotlib
I cant wait to learn about machine learning models
